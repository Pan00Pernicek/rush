//This will by far be the most complicated to do
//Basic Idea:
//If tab is hit
//check to see if it is a file in directory
//otherwise check to see if it is a program in path
//if it is already a program and it isn't a file
//check to see if it's a possible option to be autocompleted
//put in buffer
//Gonna have to learn good regex
